lca-tools
============

Repository for webapp used by Wikimedia Foundation LCA department to help with time intensive projects such as legal takedowns and confidential information releases.

This is currently a placeholder and will be expanded as we go and I have time.

Basic Installation instructions:  
1. Create database based on lcatools.sql [ generally you can do from the command line with 'mysql -u <username> -p < lcatools.sql' username being a user with create database privileges ]  
2. cp lcaToolsConfig.sample.ini to lcaToolsConfig.ini [linux/mac machines 'cp lcaToolsConfig.sample.ini lcaToolsConfig.ini']   
3. Fill out missing variables, especially API key for Chilling Effects (if using) and database credentials.
