lca-takedown
============

Repository for webapp used by Wikimedia Foundation LCA department when processing legal takedowns

This is currently a placeholder and will be expanded as we go and I have time.

Main files:
legalTakedown.html - starting page with form to fill out for take down
legalTakedownProcess.php - file to process input from form, very not working right now
